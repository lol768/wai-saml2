-- $callbackBasedMiddleware
--
-- This 'Middleware' provides a SAML2 service provider (SP) implementation
-- that can be wrapped around an existing WAI 'Application'. The middleware is
-- parameterised over the SAML2 configuration and a callback. If the middleware
-- intercepts a request made to the endpoint given by the SAML2 configuration,
-- the result of validating the SAML2 response contained in the request body
-- will be passed to the callback.

-- made to the assertation endpoint in the request vault. The inner WAI
-- application can then check of the presence of an assertion or an error with 
-- 'V.lookup' and 'assertionKey' or 'errorKey' respectively. At most one of 
-- the two locations will be populated for a given request, i.e. it is not
-- possible for an assertion to be validated and an error to occur.
